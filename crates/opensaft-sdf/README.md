# ðŸ§ƒ OpenSaft-sdf

Signed distance field interpreter and function library

This is a fork of Embark Studios' [`saft-sdf`](https://crates.io/crates/saft-sdf) with the intent of making its source code more accessible to the public.

Previously, the original library's source code was only available through its published crate. It was never published to a public code repository, and [directional changes](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem/commit/61f0ec820350a9e107f92e2dc189217d313c75db) at Embark suggest that this is unlikely to occur in the near future.

Additionally, this fork removes the dependency on [`macaw`](https://crates.io/crates/macaw) in favour of using [`glam`](https://crates.io/crates/glam) directly. This should ease integration with other Rust projects, including [`bevy`](https://crates.io/crates/bevy).
